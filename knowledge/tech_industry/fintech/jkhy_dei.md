# Jack Henry and Associates - diversity, equity, inclusion, and belonging

Our commitment to valuing diversity, prioritizing inclusion, pursuing equity,
and fostering belonging are values that enhance our strong organizational
culture and allow us to better serve our clients. Jack Henry’s diversity, equity,
inclusion, and belonging (DEIB) strategy revolves around three areas of focus:
In calendar year 2023, Jack Henry launched our first DEIB Advisory Council,
comprised of eight leaders with distinct points of view, representing
multiple areas of the business. The Council provides insight, advocates
for ideas, and drives outcomes for the DEIB strategy. To support strong
governance in this area, DEIB is also discussed at the Board level through the
Human Capital & Compensation Committee, and Jack Henry’s Corporate
Leadership Team reviews diversity initiatives and data on a quarterly basis.
