# Jack Henry and Associates - Fiscal Year 2023

Fiscal year 2023 proved to be a tumultuous
year in financial services with persistent
inflation, interest rate increases, and the failure
of several highly specialized banks. Through
all the challenges, Jack Henry’s associates
persevered and enabled us to deliver another
solid financial performance, increase client
satisfaction scores, and achieve record sales.

Our more than 7,000 associates – working
in all 50 states – collaborated with one
another throughout the year to support both
Jack Henry™ and our clients. We are thankful
for their ongoing hard work and dedication.

As you may already know, Jack Henry employs a
continuous listening strategy, sending employee
engagement surveys to our associates on their
work anniversaries. This approach allows us to
receive feedback from our associates virtually
every day of the year. This year’s results showed
that 79% of associates trust Jack Henry and 77%
feel a sense of belonging at work. We are honored
to earn those kudos from our associates and to
receive national and regional recognition as a
top workplace. Jack Henry ranked on Newsweek’s
100 Most Loved Workplaces and America’s
Greatest Workplaces lists; Computerworld’s Best
Places to Work in IT list for the 11th consecutive
year; and the lists of the Top Workplaces in
Atlanta, Charlotte, Dallas, and Kentucky.

Our associates in turn provide strong service levels
for our financial institution clients as reflected in
the consistently high client satisfaction scores
we receive on thousands of monthly surveys. This
year our client satisfaction scores averaged a
4.6 out of 5 for overall satisfaction and a 4.75 out
of 5 for overall customer service representative
satisfaction – both are increases over our already
industry-leading satisfaction scores. Throughout
our 47-year history, delivering outstanding
customer service has been a hallmark of our
company and leads to deeper relationships
with our clients.

During fiscal year 2023 we grew total revenue by
7% for the year and 8% on a non-GAAP basis – a
reflection of our proven, sustainable business
model, well-rounded array of solutions, and
service quality. More than 90% of our revenue
is recurring, and our client retention rate is
well over 99%. The limited bank merger and
acquisition (M&A) activity in the year had a
significant financial impact because of a decline
in deconversion fees and ”convert/merge” revenue.

As I’ve said before, deconversion revenue is the
revenue you don’t want to see because it means
that we’ve lost a client to M&A; however, the
decline did impact our revenue for the year.
