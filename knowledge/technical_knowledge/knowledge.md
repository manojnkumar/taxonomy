# IBM Power Terms and Acronyms

## Agile integration

Agile integration is the approach that allows microservices to be dropped into the architecture seamlessly or to be removed or updated without disrupting other services. 

Routing, orchestration, messaging, or data services are the points where a new service interacts with the environment. This is an application or service level perspective of integration.

## APM - Application Performance Monitoring or Management

In the fields of information technology and systems management, application performance management (APM) is the monitoring and management of performance and availability of software applications. APM strives to detect and diagnose complex application performance problems to maintain an expected level of service. APM is "the translation of IT metrics into business meaning ([i.e.] value)."[1]

## BMC - Baseboard Management Console

## BP - Business Partner

A business partner is a commercial entity with which another commercial entity has some form of alliance. This relationship may be a contractual, exclusive bond in which both entities commit not to ally with third parties. Alternatively, it may be a very loose arrangement designed largely to impress customers and competitors with the size of the network that the business partners belong to. [source]

## CAGR - Compound Annual Growth Rate

The compound annual growth rate (CAGR) is the rate of return (RoR) that would be required for an investment to grow from its beginning balance to its ending balance, assuming the profits were reinvested at the end of each period of the investment's life span.

## Cap Ex - Capital Expenditure

Paying for something up front

## Data Lake

Originally coined by the former CTO of Pentaho, a data lake is a low-cost storage environment, which typically houses petabytes of raw data. Unlike a data warehouse, a data lake can store both structured and unstructured data, and it does not require a defined schema to store data, a characteristic known as “schema-on-read.” This flexibility in storage requirements is particularly useful for data scientists, data engineers, and developers, allowing them to access data for data discovery exercises and machine learning projects.

https://www.ibm.com/topics/data-lake

## Data Warehouse

A data warehouse, or enterprise data warehouse (EDW), is a system that aggregates data from different sources into a single, central, consistent data store to support data analysis, data mining, artificial intelligence (AI), and machine learning. A data warehouse system enables an organization to run powerful analytics on huge volumes (petabytes and petabytes) of historical data in ways that a standard database cannot.

Data warehousing systems have been a part of business intelligence (BI) solutions for over three decades, but they have evolved recently with the emergence of new data types and data hosting methods.

https://www.ibm.com/topics/data-warehouse

## DCUT - Design, Code, Unit Test

## DevSecOps

DevSecOps is a trending practice in application security (AppSec) that involves introducing security earlier in the software development life cycle (SDLC). It also expands the collaboration between development and operations teams to integrate security teams in the software delivery cycle. DevSecOps requires a change in culture, process, and tools across these core functional teams and makes security a shared responsibility. Everyone involved in the SDLC has a role to play in building security into the DevOps continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) workflow. Source

## Distributed Network

A distributed network is a type of computer network that is spread over different networks. This provides a single data communication network, which can be managed jointly or separately by each network. Besides shared communication within the network, a distributed network often also distributes processing.

## EDA - Event Driven Architecture

Event-driven architecture is a software architecture and model for application design. With an event-driven system, the capture, communication, processing, and persistence of events are the core structure of the solution. This differs from a traditional request-driven model. (source)

## Edge Computing

Edge computing is computing that takes place at or near the physical location of either the user or the source of the data. By placing computing services closer to these locations, users benefit from faster, more reliable services while companies benefit from the flexibility of hybrid cloud computing. Edge computing is one way that a company can use and distribute a common pool of resources across a large number of locations.

Measure of the responsiveness of a network, often expressed as the round-trip time (in milliseconds); that is, the time between initiating a network request and receiving a response. 

High network latency can dramatically increase webpage load times, interrupt video and audio streams, and render an application unusable. Depending on the application, even a relatively small increase in latency can ruin UX.

(source)

## LPAR - Logial Partition

## Message Broker

Message brokers are an inter-application communication technology to help build a common integration mechanism to support cloud native, microservices-based, serverless and hybrid cloud architectures.

A message broker is software that enables applications, systems, and services to communicate with each other and exchange information. The message broker does this by translating messages between formal messaging protocols. This allows interdependent services to “talk” with one another directly, even if they were written in different languages or implemented on different platforms.

## Serverless

Serverless is a cloud computing application development and execution model that enables developers to build and run application code without provisioning or managing servers or backend infrastructure.

Serverless lets developers put all their focus into writing the best front-end application code and business logic they can. All developers need to do is write their application code and deploy it to containers managed by a cloud service provider.

Also important: With serverless, developers never pay for idle capacity. The cloud provider spins up and provisions the required computing resources on demand when the code executes, and spins them back down again—called ‘scaling to zero’—when execution stops. The billing starts when execution starts, and ends when execution stops; typically, pricing is based on execution time and resources required.

## Terraform

Terraform is an open source “Infrastructure as Code” tool, created by HashiCorp.

A declarative coding tool, Terraform enables developers to use a high-level configuration language called HCL (HashiCorp Configuration Language) to describe the desired “end-state” cloud or on-premises infrastructure for running an application. It then generates a plan for reaching that end-state and executes the plan to provision the infrastructure.

Because Terraform uses a simple syntax, can provision infrastructure across multiple cloud and on-premises data centers, and can safely and efficiently re-provision infrastructure in response to configuration changes, it is currently one of the most popular infrastructure automation tools available. If your organization plans to deploy a hybrid cloud or multicloud environment, you’ll likely want or need to get to know Terraform.
