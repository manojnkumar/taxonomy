# IBM Power Terms and Acronyms

## IQM - Infrastructure Quality Monitoring

Referenced in the Instana sellers enablement learning path, i.e. Instana APM and Instana IQM

Why offer IQM? Why not just APM?

In 99% of deals, APM – with its full functionality, is the right fit

IQM is a fit for very large deals where the client is doing infrastructure monitoring across the enterprise, and the full APM cost is too much

## ISV - Independent Software Vendor

Independent Software Vendor that runs on one or more computer hardware or OS platforms

Ex: SAP & Oracle

IBM resource: https://www.ibm.com/it-infrastructure/z/resources/independent-software-vendor

## IT Automation

IT automation, sometimes referred to as infrastructure automation, is the use of software to create repeatable instructions and processes to replace or reduce human interaction with IT systems. Automation software works within the confines of those instructions, tools, and frameworks to carry out the tasks with little to no human intervention.

Automation is key to IT optimization and digital transformation. Modern, dynamic IT environments need to be able to scale faster than ever and IT automation is vital to making that happen.

## ITIL - IT Infrastructure Library

## ITSM - IT Service Management

IT service management -- often referred to as ITSM -- is simply how IT teams manage the end-to-end delivery of IT services to customers. This includes all the processes and activities to design, create, deliver, and support IT services.

## KVM - Kernal-based Virtual Machine

Kernel-based Virtual Machine (KVM) is an open source virtualization technology built into Linux®. Specifically, KVM lets you turn Linux into a hypervisor that allows a host machine to run multiple, isolated virtual environments called guests or virtual machines (VMs).

KVM is part of Linux. If you’ve got Linux 2.6.20 or newer, you’ve got KVM. KVM was first announced in 2006 and merged into the mainline Linux kernel version a year later. Because KVM is part of existing Linux code, it immediately benefits from every new Linux feature, fix, and advancement without additional engineering.

## KYC - "Know Your Customer"

KYC (Know Your Customer) is today a significant element in the fight against financial crime and money laundering, and customer identification is the most critical aspect as it is the first step to better perform in the other stages of the process.

The global anti-money laundering (AML) and countering the financing of terrorism (CFT) landscape raise tremendous stakes for financial institutions. International regulations influenced by standards like The Financial Action Task Force (FATF) are now implemented in national laws encompassing strong directives like AML 4 and 5 and preventive measures like "KYC" for client identification.

## Latency

Measure of the responsiveness of a network, often expressed as the round-trip time (in milliseconds); that is, the time between initiating a network request and receiving a response. 

High network latency can dramatically increase webpage load times, interrupt video and audio streams, and render an application unusable. Depending on the application, even a relatively small increase in latency can ruin UX.

(source)

## LPAR - Logial Partition

## Message Broker

Message brokers are an inter-application communication technology to help build a common integration mechanism to support cloud native, microservices-based, serverless and hybrid cloud architectures.

A message broker is software that enables applications, systems, and services to communicate with each other and exchange information. The message broker does this by translating messages between formal messaging protocols. This allows interdependent services to “talk” with one another directly, even if they were written in different languages or implemented on different platforms.

## Microservices

Microservices architecture is an approach in which a single application is composed of many loosely coupled and independently deployable smaller services. 

Source

## Middleware

Middleware is software and cloud services that provide common services and capabilities to applications and help developers and operators build and deploy applications more efficiently. Middleware acts like the connective tissue between applications, data, and users.

## Node

A node is any physical device within a network of other tools that’s able to send, receive, or forward information. A personal computer is the most common node. It's called the computer node or internet node. 

## Non-functional requirements

Broadly, functional requirements define what a system is supposed to do and non-functional requirements define how a system is supposed to be. Functional requirements are usually in the form of "system shall do <requirement>", an individual action or part of the system, perhaps explicitly in the sense of a mathematical function, a black box description input, output, process and control functional model or IPO Model. In contrast, non-functional requirements are in the form of "system shall be <requirement>", an overall property of the system as a whole or of a particular aspect and not a specific function.

## Provisioning

Provisioning is the process of creating and setting up IT infrastructure, and includes the steps required to manage user and system access to various resources. Provisioning is an early stage in the deployment of servers, applications, network components, storage, edge devices, and more. 

Provisioning is not the same thing as configuration management, but they are both steps in the deployment process. Once a system has been provisioned, the next step is to configure the system and maintain it consistently over time.

## PSIRT - IBM Product Security Incident Response Team 

IBM PSIRT is the centralized process through which IBM customers, security researchers, industry groups, government organizations, or vendors report potential IBM security vulnerabilities. IBM is committed to responding to new threats and risks. IBM's Secure Engineering practices were designed so that IBM can act in a timely fashion to a reported security vulnerability affecting an IBM product or solution. To help protect our customers, IBM does not publicly disclose or confirm security vulnerabilities until IBM has conducted an analysis of the product and issued fixes and/or mitigations.

## Serverless

Serverless is a cloud computing application development and execution model that enables developers to build and run application code without provisioning or managing servers or backend infrastructure.

Serverless lets developers put all their focus into writing the best front-end application code and business logic they can. All developers need to do is write their application code and deploy it to containers managed by a cloud service provider.

Also important: With serverless, developers never pay for idle capacity. The cloud provider spins up and provisions the required computing resources on demand when the code executes, and spins them back down again—called ‘scaling to zero’—when execution stops. The billing starts when execution starts, and ends when execution stops; typically, pricing is based on execution time and resources required.

## SI - Systems Integrator

A systems integrator (or system integrator) is a person or company that specializes in bringing together component subsystems into a whole and ensuring that those subsystems function together, a practice known as system integration. They also solve problems of automation. Source

Examples of SIs are: Deloitte, IBM Consulting, Accenture, TCS, Accenture, Cognizant, HCL, Infosys, etc

## SLA - Service Level Agreement

An SLA is an agreement between a vendor and a paying customer. Companies providing a service to users for free are unlikely to want or need an SLA for those free users.

## SLI - Service Level Indicator

An SLI (service level indicator) measures compliance with an SLO (service level objective). 

https://www.atlassian.com/incident-management/kpis/sla-vs-slo-vs-sli

## SLO - Service Level Objective

An SLO (service level objective) is an agreement within an SLA about a specific metric like uptime or response time. So, if the SLA is the formal agreement between you and your customer, SLOs are the individual promises you’re making to that customer.

https://www.atlassian.com/incident-management/kpis/sla-vs-slo-vs-sli

## SOD - Statement of Direction

A statement of direction serves two purposes:

An internal alignment document to communicate the problem areas that the business will be investigating – giving sales the ability to talk confidently about future direction

An external document and presentation that captures the main themes for future product direction, enabling customers and prospects to buy into the future vision

A statement of direction is not a roadmap: it doesn’t cover the specific features that are being planned, or give estimated timelines. Instead, it describes the problem areas and innovation themes that the business is strategically investing in.

## TCA - Total Cost of Acquisition

## TCO - Total Cost of Ownership

TCO is the metric that organizations use to quantify and measure cloud adoption success. This perspective helps you understand the return on investment so that you can prioritize and focus. By capturing the key cost considerations, you gain a workable model that you can use to make informed decisions. (source)

## Terraform

Terraform is an open source “Infrastructure as Code” tool, created by HashiCorp.

A declarative coding tool, Terraform enables developers to use a high-level configuration language called HCL (HashiCorp Configuration Language) to describe the desired “end-state” cloud or on-premises infrastructure for running an application. It then generates a plan for reaching that end-state and executes the plan to provision the infrastructure.

Because Terraform uses a simple syntax, can provision infrastructure across multiple cloud and on-premises data centers, and can safely and efficiently re-provision infrastructure in response to configuration changes, it is currently one of the most popular infrastructure automation tools available. If your organization plans to deploy a hybrid cloud or multicloud environment, you’ll likely want or need to get to know Terraform.
